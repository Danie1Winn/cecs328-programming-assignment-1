Testing / Grading Instructions:

1. Upon running the program, you will be presented with 3 options: Random list generation, manual list entry, or quit. Choose option 1 (random generation).
2. Enter the number and size of the lists you wish to generate. Choosing 10 lists with a length of 3 usually yields some symmetric lists.
3. Once your 10 lists have been generated, enter the number of the list you wish to test for symmetry. I've added an asterisk (*) next to the symmetric lists for ease of testing.
4. The program will output the selected list, flipped list, and True or False for symmetry. 
5. The program loops, press 3 to quit.
